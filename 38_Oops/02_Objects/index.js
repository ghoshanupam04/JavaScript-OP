//In JavaScript all the things are Object.

//So the big question?? Function is a object?

//describe this in code:
function multiplication(number){
    return number*5;
}
multiplication.power=2
console.log(multiplication(5));
console.log(multiplication.power);
console.log(multiplication.prototype); //Empry Object 

// => function is a function and this is also a object.
